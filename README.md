# DataScience&StatsPortfolio
Hello, my name is Rose McCormack, and I am a transgender woman seeking a Computer Science degree in hopes of becoming a Data Scientist or Statistician. My code will primarily be used for data-related, statistical, and economical purposes. I hope to hone in my Computer Science concepts and apply them to the real world. 

My domain knowledge is economics and I am currently learning PostgreSQL, Python, and R through DataCamp and Coursera. I am currently learning basic uses of this website which will allow me to create and collaborate more projects. Thank you, and have a wonderful day.
