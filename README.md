Hello, my name is Rose McCormack, and I am a transgender woman seeking a Computer Science degree in hopes of becoming a Data Scientist. My code will primarily be used for business, economic, and scientific purposes. I am not a web developer, software developer, or hardware developer. I am a simple data-oriented woman who wants to change the world using computers, data, and mathematics. 

My domain knowledge is economics and I am currently learning the basics of computer science mathematics along with using inferential statistics in the R programming language. I will start using my GitHub account more often as I develop my skills.
